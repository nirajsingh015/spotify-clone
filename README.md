Spotify Clone is a simple project built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project aims to mimic the Spotify web player UI and functionalities. It provides a basic understanding of how to design and build a responsive web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Installation
To run the project locally on your machine, you can follow these steps:

Clone the repository using the following command:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/{YOUR_USERNAME}/spotify-clone.git
Open the project folder in your code editor.

Open the index.html file in your web browser or by using a local server like Live Server in Visual Studio Code.

Usage
The project consists of two main pages: the home page and the player page. The home page displays a list of songs, and the player page allows you to play a selected song.

You can navigate between these pages using the navigation bar located at the top of the screen. Clicking on a song on the home page will take you to the player page, where you can play, pause, or skip the song.
